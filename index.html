Melanoma is a type of skin cancer which arises due to in pigment cells called melanocytes [2]. Skin Cancer is the most prevalent cancer in the United States, impacting an astonishing 1 out of every 5 individuals in the nation [1]. Although Melanoma is not the most common type of skin cancer, it causes a large majority of skin cancer deaths [3], projected to cause over 10,000 deaths in America alone in the 2016 calendar year [1]. Detection of the cancer at its early stages can be vital to preventing the exacerbation of the health issue. Therefore, creating a tool for the rapid detection of melanoma - from a smartphone - can have an immensely positive impact.</p>
        <p class="rs">
          To build Dermyx, IBM Watson along with a dataset of images webscraped from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (https://isic-archive.com/#images) was leveraged. This was paired with computer vision to isolate the part of the arm and to edit the histogram of the image to optimize it for analysis. An iOS app was built to deliver the tech.

Through the iOS App, citizens can point their camera at armed militants and tap the screen to report them. To prevent people from reporting falsely, the images are analyzed to look for people and firearms (neural network analysis). Also, they can access militant data to know if they are in a high danger area. Finally, they can access a pathfinding tool to find the safest walking/driving path from their current location to another. The pathfinding algorithm avoids high-danger areas (areas with high concentrations of militants) within reasonable bounds. Militants are tracked from multiple phones through an implementation of SSIM tracking.

I love material design because of its intuitive UI design and its bold, bright, colors.</p></div>

I'm extremely grateful that I had this experience, and I believe I grew exponentially as an actor after these performances. </p></div>
